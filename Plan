Goal: Create a network of regulation by master transcription factors from ATAC-seq data

Input data: ATAC-seq peaks (coordinates and heights) detected by HMCan: https://bitbucket.org/pyminer/hmcan Citation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3834794/

Data availability: I will share with you ATAC-seq data for GM12878, K562, SKNMC and H1hES cells in a separate email.

 

Additional data you will need for hg19:

- TADs in human cells from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63525 , a file containing all possible TADs can be downloaded from https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/SR0EsJ2tbth53PC

- predicted promoter-enhancer interactions in human cells (FANTOM5 dataset) from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670763 . The corresponding file can be downloaded from https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/GVVVfiClw48vkY8

- HOCOMOCO database of TF motifs (+ PWM thresholds corresponding to p-value of 0.0001) Citation: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4702883/ PWMs and thresholds can be downloaded from http://hocomoco11.autosome.ru/

 

Steps:

 

1. Annotate ATAC-seq peaks as

- promoters (i.e. regions overlapping +-5Kb regions around gene transcription start sites (TSSs))

- enhancers (everything else)*

* strong CTCF binding sites will be annotated later

-- нужно выделить пики из *.narrowPeaks - сделать файл с ними
-- выделить TSS из hg19
-- найти где они пересекаются в регионе +-5Kb от TSS - промотеры, остальные .narrowPeaks = энхансеры

 

2. Make a list of genes that have ATAC-seq peaks in promoters. All genes without ATAC-seq peaks in the promoter will be considered as "not expressed" and will be excluded from further analysis.

 

3. Assign enhancers and promoters to genes

- for promoters it is rather straight forwards. However if TSSs of two genes are very close a promoter can be assigned to two genes

- for enhancers:

                o if this enhancer is present (e.g. overlaps) an enhancer in the FANTOM5 database, assign it to genes from FANTOM5

                o if not, assign enhancer to all expressed genes in a TAD

 

4. Detect HOCOMOCO TFBS motifs in enhancers and promoters but scanning corresponding DNA sequences with HOCOMOCO PWMs and (10^-4) affinity thresholds (I hope there exists already a module for this written in Python that you can find and use)

 

5. Construct a graph

- nodes include information about

                o gene name *

                o is it a TF *

                o for TFs: outgoing edges  *

                o for all genes including TFs: incoming edges  *

                o incoming score = log2(sum scores of incoming edges) ***

                o outgoing score = log2(sum scores of outgoing edges) ***

- edges include information about

                o regulating TF  *

                o regulated gene  *

                o number of enhancer elements  *

                o total number of binding motif hits (in all enhancers+promoter) *

                o information as to whether the gene promoter is bound or it is only enhancers   *

                o edge score = (total number of PWM hits) x (total number of ATAC-seq peaks for the target gene: enhancers+promoter with a motif hit)  **

* - information to be filled out first

** - information filled out second

*** - information filled out third

 

6. Analyze the graph

- detect putative master regulator TFs as nodes with

                o high* outgoing scores

                o thick* "auto"-edge (e.g. the TF binds to its own gene to many enhancer regions)

                o all master TFs should be connected by edges (probably with score* >3)

* we have to look at the corresponding distributions and known master TFs to select thresholds on these scores

 

7. Summarize the result in output files and a summary graph
